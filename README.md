Currently a very incomplete Neural-network library.

#Goals:

* Be platform independet and hardware independent.
* Be accelerated.

#Misc:

Currently this library is incomplete, and depends on VexCL to handle accelerated computing on various enviroments.

#Todo:

* Basic back-propigation
* Saveing/loading of states
* Lots more.
